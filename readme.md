This is the raw Unity cache files for the Zenless Zone Zero x McDonald's BFF Collab.

All files have been downloaded and extracted by akaisdev. 
If you do end up using these specific files for mods or MMD, you should obviously credit MiHoYo, but I also ask you to credit me too. It was a headache to figure out how to grab these.


## HOW TO USE

These are Unity cache files, and need to be extracted for use. Using AssetStudio, load "CacheFiles" as a folder, and extract as necessary. No encryption.


## How did you get these files? OR, can I try the AR myself?

Here's the process of doing just that on iOS with no jailbreak necessary. 
(Spoofing on Android is possible but more involved and may need a newer device possibly with root.)

Requirements:
	- A phone with AR capabilities (iPhone X and newer)  
	- A Windows PC with 3uTools installed  
	- A sideloading method  
		- Signing certificate for file extraction and AR  
		- Apple Account if you just want to try the AR  

1. Requested IPA decryption via decrypt.day (https://decrypt.day/app/id1054598922)
2. Download and install to iPhone using Feather or AppDB, or using Sideloadly if just for AR
3. Connect iPhone to computer and run 3uTools and wait for phone to be loaded
4. Toolbox tab > VirtualLocation > Set latitude "23.13745464", longitude "113.31512868"   
	note: These coordinates are for the McD Guangzhou Victory Plaza Flagship location.  
	4b. Check Apple Maps on iPhone to see if GPS location was overrided, if not, retry on 3uTools.
5. Open McDonald's China app. If "Guangzhou Victory Plaza McDonald's" is shown as the set location, swipe down from the upper middle of the screen and once the text says "Drop to enter", let go.
6. Let the app download the necessary AR files, completes when app asks for camera perms.

To actually use the AR function, you need to scan the images found in the "assets/arassets/scanimage/" container in AssetStudio.
These (excluding the flagship one) must be displayed on the floor to appear correctly.

(Optional: if extracting files, requires installation via Feather or AppDB)
7. Close app, open Files app, go to "On My iPhone > McDonald's > yoo > Default"
8. Copy "CacheFiles" folder to another location, compress, then transfer to a computer if need be.

Further notes:
	- It does not need to be the Guangzhou Victory Plaza location. There are five other locations, but you'll need to find the Long+Lat coords of those.
